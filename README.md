# DS-4002--CS3

This respository contains [`case_study_deliverable`](case_study_deliverable.pdf), [`case_study_rubric`](case_study_rubric.pdf), and [`materials`](Materials) required to complete this case study

## Materials
In the "Materials" folder you will find useful resources that will guide you towards completing this case study including information on libraries, access to datasets, and context to the topic of the case study. These resources will come in handy in determing whether there is a relationship between recipe length and it's ratings.

In the `Materials` directory, you will find useful resources that will help you complete this case study including infomration on libraries that will help you with data cleaning, data extraction, and context to the topic of the case study. These resources will be helpful in determining if there exists a difference in sentiment between the two chosen movies (Barbie and Oppenheimer).

### DATA
In the data folder inside of the Materials direcotry, there is a starter script to show how to query the data from the IMDb website to create a dataset of reviews. This is just a starter script and needs to be edited with the startup materials for selenium (*see references on how to do this*).
